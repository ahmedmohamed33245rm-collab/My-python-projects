# My Python Projects

I started learning Python at age 13 and wrote these projects between 13–15.  
Some are small, others are larger (200+ lines).

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m currently a student learning programming and building my portfolio.  
This repository contains my early work in Python, and I plan to expand with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects.
